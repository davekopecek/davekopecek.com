Welcome. I'm Dave Kopecek. I live in the Catskill Mountains with my amazing wife [Barbara](http://barbara-stewart.com/) who writes [creepy YA teen fiction](http://www.amazon.com/-Between-Barbara-Stewart/dp/1250030161) and occasionally grows monster-sized butternut squash.  I run [Aisle8, Inc](http://aisle8.net) an internet consultancy that will crawl around inside your website and make it do things you never thought were possible.
