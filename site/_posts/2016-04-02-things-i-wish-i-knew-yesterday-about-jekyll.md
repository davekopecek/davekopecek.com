Trying to get [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) running on Windows 10 dev environment? Got an error that looks like this:

    SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed

Take a look at my [README](https://bitbucket.org/davekopecek/davekopecek.com) on Bitbucket.
