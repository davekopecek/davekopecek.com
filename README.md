This is my personal blog. It was created using [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes), a two column responsive Jekyll theme. I maintain and deploy this blog from a Windows 10 system. I'm not a "ruby guy" so things that may be obvious to other were certainly not to me. Here's some info about my current system:

    C:\>ruby -v
    ruby 2.0.0p645 (2015-04-13) [x64-mingw32]
    
    C:\>gem -v
    2.0.14

    C:\>jekyll -v
    jekyll 3.1.2

    C:\>bundle -v
    Bundler version 1.11.2

To start Jekyll from my projects directory

    C:\>cd Users\Dave\Projects\davekopecek\site
    bundle exec jekyll server

## Getting Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes to Run on Windows.

This took a bit of doing. Your mileage may vary.

## Getting Started

Minimal Mistakes takes advantage of Sass and data files to make customizing easier. These features require [Jekyll 2.x](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/2.1.3) and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.

To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/) for more information.
