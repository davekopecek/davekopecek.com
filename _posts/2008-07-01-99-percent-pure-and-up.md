I'd pretty much sworn off Chinese food after a series of run-ins with the super-buffet's common in the Midwest, and probably elsewhere.  Our eastward move to a teeny tiny town has left us with damn few culinary options.  After nearly a year, I wandered into Ming Moon, a strip mall restaurant squeezed in between the Rite-Aid and a Verizon store, and it was a beautiful thing.

Fast forward six months and I've eaten my way through half the menu and, but for the fried dumplings (don't let them sit for an hour in a truck and then eat 8 of them), I've been in moo-shoo, won-ton glory.

Last week I found their 100lb secret yummy ingredient, sitting right there for all to see. Had I known that all these years it was not <em><strong>MSG</strong></em> that was making me feel all itchy and odd, but <em><strong>inferior MSG</strong></em>, oh the time I could have saved. Like bad drugs cut with rat poison, inferior MSG is ruining perfectly good evenings the world over.

And I'll bet this is just the beginning...
